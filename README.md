## Topic and Purpose of the Analysis

### Topic
Gender-based Justice

### Purpose of the Analysis
Despite many countries claiming that much has been done to create a gender neutral society, we have to ask: Are developed countries truly egalitarian in terms of womens’ rights? How big is the gap between the developed and developing world?

These are some of the questions that this project seeks to answer by conducting a machine learning model that will take into account features such as enacted laws, citizens’ attitudes, etc. By the end of this project, we want to accomplish a clear classification of how different countries are positioned in terms of equality and provide a model that could predict these countries' future development of womens’ rights.

## Data Source
* The data used for this project comes from the Gender, Institutions and Development Database (GID-DB) 2019
* This data provides researchers and policymakers with key data on gender-based discrimination in social institutions
* The data assists in analyzing women’s empowerment and understanding gender gaps in other key areas of development
* It contains data on 180 countries and territories with information on legal, cultural and traditional practices that discriminate against women and girls

## Questions to be Answered
* Are developed countries truly egalitarian in terms of womens’ rights? 
* How big is the gap between the developed and developing world?
* What are the main variables that lead to a more egalitarian society?
* How do the attitudes and laws of a country respectively impact gender-based justice?

## Description of Communication Protocols
Our main communication tool will be Slack, which we will be using for sharing important documentation, dividing the tasks and responsibilities and providing quick updates. 

We will be meeting once per week in addition to the two weekly classes. These meetings will be used to discuss our progress, obstacles and next steps.

We will also join office hours from time to time to ask questions and come up with better solutions.
